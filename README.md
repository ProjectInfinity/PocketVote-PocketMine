# PocketVote for PocketMine
The best fast, extensible and scalable voting solution for PocketMine servers.

PocketVote acts as a smart-funnel for voting. You can use as many voting sites as you want and your server will never communicate with more than PocketVote's servers.

Because PocketVote acts as a funnel we're also capable of turning off the stream of votes if your sever goes offline which means no votes are lost!

Are you sold yet? If not here's a short list of some of our features:
* Automated voting (no commands needed)
* Your very own https://mcpe.guru vote link that can be managed in-game
* Run **any** command when a vote is received
    * Limit commands to users which certain permissions
    * Choose whether to run command immediately or wait for the player to be online
* Voting statistics
* Third-party support through custom events and the PocketVote API
